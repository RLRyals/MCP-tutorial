## INTERVIEW FLOW

### Opening
```
I'll help you set up your AI writing team for your series. I need to understand your genre and writing style to create the right team configuration and teach them how to use the Universal Genre Language MCP system for your specific needs.

Let me ask you some questions about your project:
```

### Phase 1: Genre Identification (5-7 questions)

**Q1: Primary Genre**
```
What's the primary genre of your series? (Romance, Mystery/Detective, Fantasy, Science Fiction, Literary Fiction, Horror, Thriller, etc.)
```

**Q2: Subgenre Specifics**
```
What subgenre or specific flavor? For example:
- Romance: Contemporary, Historical, Paranormal, Dark, Reverse Harem

- Sci-Fi: Hard, Soft, Space Opera, Cyberpunk, Time Travel
```

**Q3: Content Intensity**
```
What intensity level does your series reach?
- Low intensity (sweet/cozy content)
- Medium intensity (some mature themes)
- High intensity (explicit/graphic content)
- Variable intensity (builds throughout series)
```

**Q4: Multi-Genre Elements**
```
Does your series blend genres? If so, what's the secondary genre and how prominent is it?
Examples: Urban Fantasy Romance, Sci-Fi Mystery, Literary Horror
```

**Q5: Series Complexity**
```
Describe your series structure:

```

**Q7: World-Building Requirements**
```
What world-building elements need systematic tracking?

```

**Q8: Information Management**
```
What types of secrets, reveals, or information flow do you need to track?

- Mystery clues and evidence chains?
- Prophecies, foreshadowing, and payoffs?
- Character knowledge states (who knows what when)?
```

**Q9: Content Advisory Needs**
```
Do you need to track any sensitive content for beta readers or publishers?
- Explicit intimate scenes with consent documentation?
- Violence levels and trigger warnings?
- Cultural sensitivity considerations?
- Age-appropriate content guidelines?
```

### Phase 3: Writing Process Preferences (2-3 questions)

**Q10: AI Team Authority Level**
```
How much decision-making autonomy do you want your AI team to have?
- Low: Only provide information when asked
- Medium: Handle workflow details and minor decisions
- High: Make plot and character decisions within established guidelines
```

**Q11: AI Team Creativity Level**
```
How creative and proactive should your AI team be?
- Low: Follow your lead, provide technical assistance
- Medium: Actively suggest improvements and options
- High: Generate creative alternatives and new ideas
```

**Q12: Team Size Preference**
```
Do you prefer:
- Core team (6 personas): Showrunner, First Drafter, Genre Specialist, Character Psychologist, Research Librarian, Production Manager
- Extended team: Add additional specialists for complex multi-genre series
- Minimal team: Focus on essential roles only
```

## ANALYSIS & MAPPING PROCESS

### Step 1: Genre Pattern Recognition
Based on the author's responses, identify:
- **Primary intensity patterns** (what intensity_level 1-10 means for their genre)
- **Information reveal patterns** (what types of secrets/clues/discoveries they track)
- **Relationship complexity patterns** (what relationship_arcs they need)
- **Specialized elements patterns** (what goes in scene_elements for their genre)

### Step 2: Universal Language Mapping
Create translation layer between author's terminology and MCP fields:

**Romance Example:**
```
Author Term → Universal MCP Field
Heat Level → intensity_level
Spice Scene → scene_type: "intimate" + intensity_level 7+
Consent → agency_dynamic + validation_notes
Relationship Stage → relationship_arcs current_dynamic
```

**Mystery Example:**
```
Author Term → Universal MCP Field
Clue Significance → intensity_level
Evidence Discovery → information_reveals
Red Herring → information_reveals (false significance)
Suspect Interrogation → scene_type: "investigation"
```

### Step 3: Team Configuration
Determine:
- **Genre specialist type** (Romance, Mystery, Fantasy, Sci-Fi)
- **Authority and creativity levels** based on author preference
- **Specialized tool focus** based on tracking needs
- **Content advisory requirements** based on sensitivity needs

## SPECIAL CONSIDERATIONS

### Multi-Genre Complexity:
If series blends genres significantly, create hybrid mapping and assign multiple specialists or cross-trained specialists.

### Sensitivity Requirements:
For content requiring special handling, establish clear protocols for consent documentation, trigger warnings, or cultural sensitivity.

### Series Evolution:
Plan for series that may evolve or expand genres over time by creating flexible mapping that can adapt.

### Custom Subgenres:
For unique or emerging subgenres, focus on identifying the underlying universal patterns and creating appropriate translation layers.

This interview system ensures each author gets a perfectly configured AI writing team that speaks their genre language while leveraging the Universal MCP framework efficiently.
