# Scene Elements Guide

## Universal Framework for Genre-Specific Scene Techniques

The `scene_elements` field provides a universal way to track specialized techniques, mechanics, or components that define how a scene works within its genre. This system works across all genres while maintaining the specificity needed for quality storytelling and continuity tracking.

---

## Core Concept

**Scene Elements** capture the specialized techniques, mechanics, or components that define how a scene works within its genre. They are:

- **Genre-specific** but **universally applicable**
- **Technique-focused** rather than plot-focused
- **Trackable** for consistency and progression
- **Analyzable** for effectiveness and patterns

---

## Database Implementation

### Book Server - chapter_scenes Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE chapter_scenes (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    chapter_id INTEGER REFERENCES chapters(id),
    scene_elements TEXT[],  -- Universal genre-specific techniques
    -- ... other fields
);
```

### Plot Server - trope_scenes Table
```sql
CREATE TABLE trope_scenes (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    instance_id INTEGER REFERENCES trope_instances(id),
    scene_elements TEXT[],  -- Genre elements for trope implementation
    -- ... other fields
);
```

## Integration with World Server

Scene elements should reference established world systems when applicable:

### Example: Magic System Integration

```javascript
// 1. World Server: Define magic system
define_world_system:
  system_name: "Elemental Binding"
  system_type: "magic"
  mechanics: "Requires true name, causes physical exhaustion"
  limitations: ["Iron disrupts binding", "Maximum 3 active bindings"]

// 2. Plot Server: Use system in trope scene
implement_trope_scene:
  instance_id: 5
  scene_type_id: 12
  scene_summary: "Protagonist binds water elemental"
  scene_elements: [
    "elemental_binding",      // References world system
    "true_name_invocation",   // Uses system mechanics
    "physical_exhaustion"     // Follows system limitations
  ]
  effectiveness_rating: 9
```

---

## Validation Rules

When implementing scene elements:

### 1. Genre Consistency
Scene elements should match the trope's genre and the book's established tone.

### 2. World Rules Compliance
Elements must respect established world systems and rules:
- Magic system limitations
- Technology constraints
- Supernatural mechanics
- Physical laws

### 3. Character Knowledge
Characters must know or learn the techniques they use:
```javascript
// BAD - Character suddenly knows advanced magic
scene_elements: ["ancient_ritual", "arcane_binding"]

// GOOD - Character learns technique first
// Chapter 5: Character studies ancient texts
// Chapter 8: Character attempts ritual with mentor
scene_elements: ["learned_ritual", "mentor_guidance"]
```

### 4. Progressive Complexity
Elements should match character power/skill level:
```javascript
// Book 1 - Novice
scene_elements: ["basic_spellcasting", "simple_ward"]

// Book 3 - Experienced
scene_elements: ["complex_ritual", "multi_layer_ward", "power_channeling"]
```

---

## Query Capabilities

### Book Server Queries

**Get scenes by elements:**
```javascript
list_scenes:
  chapter_id: 12
  scene_elements: ["forensic_analysis", "witness_interrogation"]
```

**Analyze element distribution:**
```javascript
analyze_scene_flow:
  chapter_id: 15
  analysis_type: "element_distribution"
// Shows: Which elements are used most, clustering patterns
```

### Plot Server Queries

**Find trope scenes with specific elements:**
```javascript
get_trope_scenes:
  series_id: 1
  kinks_filter: ["power_exchange", "telepathic_bonding"]
```

**Analyze element effectiveness:**
```javascript
get_trope_scenes:
  instance_id: 5
// Shows: effectiveness_rating for scenes with different element combinations
```

---

## Best Practices for Authors

### 1. Define Before Use
Establish world systems/rules before adding scene elements that reference them:
```javascript
// First: Define in World Server
define_world_system: "Blood Magic System"

// Then: Use in scenes
scene_elements: ["blood_sacrifice", "life_force_transfer"]
```

### 2. Be Specific
Use precise element names:
```javascript
// ❌ Too vague
scene_elements: ["romance_stuff", "magic"]

// ✅ Specific and trackable
scene_elements: ["power_exchange", "consent_negotiation"]
scene_elements: ["elemental_summoning", "ritual_preparation"]
```

### 3. Match Genre Conventions
Use elements appropriate to your genre:
```javascript
// Paranormal Romance
scene_elements: ["blood_bond", "mate_claim", "pack_dynamics"]

// Hard SF
scene_elements: ["quantum_entanglement", "relativity_effects", "hard_vacuum_exposure"]
```

### 4. Track Progression
Show character growth through element complexity:
```javascript
// Early book - Simple elements
scene_elements: ["basic_interrogation", "visual_observation"]

// Late book - Advanced elements
scene_elements: ["psychological_profiling", "micro_expression_analysis", "timeline_synthesis"]
```

### 5. Reference Consistently
Use same element names across similar scenes for tracking:
```javascript
// All investigation scenes use consistent terminology
Scene 1: ["evidence_collection", "crime_scene_photography"]
Scene 5: ["evidence_analysis", "forensic_comparison"]
Scene 12: ["evidence_presentation", "expert_testimony"]
```

## AI Writing Team Usage

When the AI writing team sees `scene_elements`, they should:

### 1. Check World Consistency
Verify elements match established world systems:
```
"Does 'blood_magic' follow the rules defined in the Blood Magic System?"
"Are the limitations being respected?"
```

### 2. Validate Character Knowledge
Ensure characters have learned these techniques:
```
"Has the protagonist been taught 'neural_interface_protocol'?"
"Did they earn the right to use 'ancient_ritual'?"
```

### 3. Track Progression
Note character growth in element complexity:
```
"Character started with 'basic_ward' in Ch 3"
"Now using 'multi_layer_protection' in Ch 15"
"Growth trajectory is consistent"
```

### 4. Cross-Reference Systems
Link to relevant world systems, character abilities:
```
"Element 'elemental_binding' → World System 'Elemental Magic'"
"Character learned this from Mentor in Ch 7"
"Uses character's 'spirit_affinity' trait"
```

### 5. Suggest Variations
Recommend element combinations for effectiveness:
```
"Scenes combining 'forensic_analysis' + 'witness_interrogation'
 have 8.5/10 avg effectiveness"
"Suggest adding 'psychological_profiling' for this detective scene"
```

## Advanced Usage

### Element Combinations

Track which combinations are most effective:
```javascript
// High effectiveness (9/10 avg)
["forensic_analysis", "deductive_reasoning", "timeline_reconstruction"]

// Lower effectiveness (6/10 avg)
["witness_interrogation", "false_lead_placement"]

// Optimal combo found through analysis
["evidence_collection", "psychological_profiling", "hidden_motive"]
```

### Cross-Book Tracking

Monitor element evolution across series:
```javascript
// Book 1: Basic magic
scene_elements: ["simple_spell", "wand_focus"]

// Book 3: Intermediate
scene_elements: ["complex_ritual", "multi_element_weaving"]

// Book 5: Advanced
scene_elements: ["wandless_casting", "reality_manipulation", "dimensional_magic"]
```

### Genre Blending

Combine elements from multiple genres:
```javascript
// Urban Fantasy Romance
scene_elements: [
    "blood_magic",           // Fantasy
    "power_exchange",        // Romance
    "crime_scene_analysis"   // Mystery
]
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### Problem: Elements feel disconnected from story

**Solution:** Link elements to established world systems
```javascript
// Instead of arbitrary elements
scene_elements: ["magic_blast", "energy_shield"]

// Reference your world building
scene_elements: [
    "runic_channeling",      // From established Runic Magic System
    "mana_shield_layer_3"    // Character's current skill level
]
```

### Problem: Too many elements per scene

**Solution:** Focus on 3-5 most important techniques
```javascript
// ❌ Overwhelming
scene_elements: ["blood_play", "power_exchange", "telepathy",
                 "vulnerability", "trust", "consent", "dominance", "submission"]

// ✅ Focused
scene_elements: ["power_exchange", "telepathic_bonding", "vulnerability_moment"]
```

### Problem: Inconsistent naming across scenes

**Solution:** Create a series "element dictionary"
```javascript
// Define standard terms at series level
Series Element Dictionary:
- "forensic_analysis" (not "CSI work" or "lab testing")
- "witness_interrogation" (not "questioning" or "interview")
- "timeline_reconstruction" (not "timeline building")
```
